0:00
hey everybody Welcome to the next commentary today we're playing Vladimir mid lane versus an echo also I think he
0:07
was a challenger Echo too so this is going to be hard because I'm not the most proficient at Vladimir but I do
0:12
understand the champion enough to know what he needs to do to succeed but can we get it to that point because he
0:18
definitely is a scaling laner who is absolutely ridiculous uh if you can make
0:23
it to like two or three items in high levels uh he has really high cooldowns early on so that's kind of what makes
0:29
him uh kind of struggle during the early game of course there's plenty of times where I've seen people actually kill
0:35
people early on his blood if they disrespect you but uh don't worry they have to make like huge misplays for you
0:41
to actually uh punish them so I would definitely say it's not a generic thing to happen
0:47
so I'm going to Auto attack this one creep to get it low so hopefully they uh are kind of
0:52
dying at different speeds so I can easily last hit it with auto attacks
0:58
I'll have to use Q here no matter what but that's okay
1:12
oh I was trying to get Q there as well on him because Vlad is a point-and-click
1:17
champion is sometimes is kind of hard to uh oh he's gonna reach level two and then all in let's see or that's what he
1:24
wanted to do but didn't
1:30
the good news is that believe it or not that trade I landed a empowered queue on him so it actually wasn't too bad the
1:37
risk right now is that he has ignite so that creates a lot of pressure on me to
1:43
not die to uh his all in because Echo has crazy good burst
1:49
so I'm just gonna try to trim this it's going to be kind of hard because my e cost HP so I actually can damage Myself
1:55
by uh trying to fix the wave so we're probably just gonna have to let it crash in this Farm
2:04
I'm far away like this oh does that die dude
2:13
I couldn't even cue that one either a bit of a bummer
2:22
dude I don't know where this guy went if he reset or if he's grouping with his team or what
2:27
it's kind of nerve-wracking there's a chance that he just backed and
2:33
bought another item because Echo is crazy strong pushing power early game so it's really difficult to punish uh him
2:40
just pushing for free I was trying to get that creep learn oh
2:45
well we are creating a slow push ourselves we actually can reset or we just stay in
2:52
Lane until we finish our core item that we can buy which is um a hextech alternator which costs 1050.
3:01
the the main goal versus Echo is just don't get it by his three hit passive as long as we don't get hit by that
3:07
um creating won't go too bad for us oh she could have viewed him there so
3:15
well played good trade use his W to Shield himself I mean I'm not even looking for trades
3:20
at this point honestly I don't think it's good to do because he's just stronger since he got to buy and I
3:25
didn't oh I actually got the heel off surprised he went for a trade well or he missed
3:33
timed his trade
3:38
I should say
3:45
healing off a creeps gives less Health than hitting him so that's why it's kind of important that I hit him with that
3:50
empowered Q so I'm kind of lucky that it even landed
4:07
I'm just gonna pull the um oh lee sin's here too
4:17
huh I actually just die holy crap for some reason I thought that the Lee sin wouldn't be able to deal enough damage
4:23
but well I have a perfect purchase so that's kind of nice the bad news is that I miss
4:29
a bunch of creeps and also Lisa got a free kill off of me
4:35
I didn't respect his damage but at the same time I had empowered cue so there's a chance that I could have outplayed
4:41
where I could have just landed an empowered Hue on him and and stepped up towards him and let him land the queue
4:47
because I did just get a normal key which doesn't heal as much so that could be a problem
4:53
the only good news about dying early is that we playing scaling it would be different if we were playing an early
4:59
game Champion like if we were just like dying on repeat playing like Kiana Kiana does scale but she's not a
5:06
champion that you're supposed to be losing anyways I think that she's definitely a champion that's like okay if you're not if you're dying too much
5:12
you're going to become useless pretty fast I think that Vlad is kind of different
5:19
I can't rotate down but I don't have boots or anything so they're on their own down there he got
5:25
first push because I died the least in gank and then because I
5:30
died of Elise and gank uh Echo got to shove in for free and then I guess he reset immediately when
5:37
bought so he's missing a big wave but it's worth it because you got um my team so they're getting denied
5:42
creeps as well
5:50
foreign I was trying to get both at the same time because honestly I'm just trying to shove this in
6:00
okay I got the tower plate I'm gonna try to back off immediately we have magical Footwear these are the runes that I'm
6:06
running this game it's standard Vlad runes according to at least what the websites that I use just looking at the highest One Rate this is apparently the
6:12
highest one so that's the reason for going for it
6:19
since he is melee it doesn't mean that we can step up like this and get good trades off which is really nice
6:30
oh he even misses Cannon huge
6:42
okay I mean I don't know why this flood is on me but all right four people mid lane I saw that this guy was six so honestly
6:49
I thought that maybe we could do something because I landed a huge ulti and how your ulti works
6:55
is that it it deals good damage and heals you but it also puts a debuff on them and the debuff increases the damage
7:02
from everyone for 10 seconds so Wukong my whole entire team deals 10 more
7:08
damage to those people so I was hoping that maybe we could do something with it but
7:14
uh with Clyde also being there I guess there was just no opportunity
7:19
oh huge damage then powered queues are hitting so hard now
7:25
yeah because this guy's a melee you can see that I can just kind of Step Up every single time he goes for the wave
7:31
and just poking out of Lane the thing is that I don't really know what to do with my advantage I could
7:36
maybe look for roams diving honestly is pretty damn strong and you see how they're going for maybe a ball play
7:42
possibly that could mean that I could rotate
7:47
no they didn't go for it though this bar just did it's not running towards me so I can't
7:52
really collapse
7:59
uh I'm just gonna clear out vision control I think that's one of the best things that I can do they're leasing based so I should be
8:05
okay here this guy's actually really strong so I actually don't want to walk back in this way because he'll just jump on me so I'll just run down instead and
8:12
then I'll go back to trying to clear as fast as I can because I'm worried about the Wukong doing the rift Herald and then Echo like rotates on him
8:19
I'm just gonna use my pull here as long as he goes for me that's fine because I actually care about getting that
8:26
that objective doesn't matter if he goes for me I'll just use my pool to keep myself alive
8:37
I have to wait until my pool is back up
8:43
before I can walk if I walk in and I don't have pool I am very vulnerable I die very quickly
8:49
so
8:55
oh wow that doesn't kill
9:01
a little bit of damage we'll just trade back a little bit
9:11
I mean I'm slowing them down but and I did land a good ultimate as well
9:17
okay nice I got stunned
9:22
doing that was actually kind of scary because the thing not like I'm gonna die because I had a pool and everything but
9:27
I didn't know if my damage is actually useful to get that lease in because we saw him use Ward hop so I was like I can Flash I
9:34
had an empowered q and I wanted to use it immediately so basically we had a window to immediately do a big damaged
9:40
queue and I was hoping my team could follow it up but I didn't know if they could so I was actually kind of scared that maybe this would just be Troll and
9:47
then I just don't get anything from it I waste my flash but thankfully it looks like we actually did get an assist
9:53
got a kill even though Bard was there too and even used ultimate got a big wave in as well
10:01
I guess we're just gonna sell this so this is fine we have Night Harvester
10:06
night Harvester is a huge item for Vlad because it gives these little damage things on everybody so if you land a
10:12
huge multi-man ultimate on not ultimate but I guess e because your ultimate actually doesn't deal damage it deals
10:18
delay damage but you have huge AOE damage so you can get five night Harvester procs inside of a team fight
10:23
150 damage to each person that's that's a lot for your whole entire team
10:28
foreign oh nice and we got boots very sick oh there's a Bard around mid
10:36
we're up 10 CS on the guy and we're slowly gonna become an absolute Menace level 13 is one of the biggest spikes
10:42
because uh that's when you're equal or not cooldown your e uh level will be
10:49
level five so when my level five ability e is ready it's gonna be on a 3.5 second
10:56
cooldown okay you just want to go
11:02
foreign dude this is so weird I didn't know if I
11:08
wanted to collab spot to help out my team but Wukong saying King mid because we can use Rift Herald to get the tower it's like
11:14
who split calls at once I went for the Wukong play but Collette went mid but that's
11:19
okay because blood went mid that means my team is gonna be able to push out top now Alison's kind of spooky he could be
11:26
inside of our jungle doing like red buff and stuff so it's gonna get a little bit of poke on this guy at Phase rush out
11:33
they're not chasing so they should be okay there I'm gonna ping that this guy's missing again so we hopefully
11:39
don't get Laps on by that guy I honestly think bot Rome is good I just need to fix this wave and I
11:45
should be able to next e and then I can uh head out
11:53
oh he's just dead nice this is warded no
12:00
I mean I'm just gonna halfway rotate
12:05
I don't think that we can do this
12:11
she just left Towers so I should just leave yeah this was warded as well so I'm out of here
12:21
pretty sure the ghost Ward that pops up is not supposed to pop up unless they actually see the ward expire so
12:28
should tell us that they have vision control nice Pappy also has so many
12:36
um I'm gonna just cue him got face Rush
12:43
here my next queue is available soon this guy does have ignite that's the scary part about this matchup honestly
12:48
I'm gonna cue him again
12:54
once again huge heal because I had that empowered hue
13:01
okay I healed off of that guy too I have my ultimate taking as well
13:09
let's go for this guy now I'm waiting for him to go over the wall nice I
13:15
didn't want to go over and then Bard stuns both of us and then we're in a dangerous spot where Echo could maybe use his stun and stuff I have my pool
13:21
available so I will face check oh nice another kill yeah that's the thing you're just so damn tanky and hard to
13:27
kill so even though they tried to gank me there it just didn't work out I'm just gonna flash on them
13:34
what I did there was I charged up my q and you can Flash as you're charging it and I also had my queue available empowered so
13:41
um the longer you hold down your e the more damage it deals except for that it
13:46
does cap out so that's like kind of an important thing to look at um
13:52
I'll show an example so like right here you're gonna see a bar and you see how when it goes all the
13:58
way up it didn't immediately pop you actually get slowed so you can like hold on to it
14:04
that's the time to flash in right but you can that's full charge it's when it deals the most damage so you can just
14:10
right now like you can do it really fast you don't need to wait and hold it the entire time you can let go pretty early
14:17
not only that but also delays your Q don't know if I mentioned that this isn't my first flight game I've been trying to do a few recordings of it but
14:24
as an example your Q needs to be used and powered pretty fast you can use your e to delay it see how it's going slower
14:30
when I'm using my e where uh it keeps the charge going for a little bit longer so you can use that
14:37
sometimes to delay it so you get that empowered to queue off dude why am I not balling here unless we
14:42
like dive or something this echo's just getting pre-formed
14:51
we can't even like help out with this whatever let's just get mint Tower Min
14:56
Tower is like a huge objective so it's not gonna be that bad Echo might try to rotate on us
15:02
Through the Jungle so I might get into a skirmish plus I don't have any cue stack so it's going to take Q two cues to
15:07
charge my empowered one when normally it always takes one because whenever you're using a powered queue it gives you one
15:13
more stack so when you're at zero it's like kind of awkward because that's the only time when it is not every other
15:19
queue you have to press it twice otherwise this every other is empowered
15:27
I was gonna go death cab second because that's what it says the highest win rate is but I didn't have enough for a needless so I figure going for shadow
15:32
flame isn't that bad it gives HP as well and Vladimir's passive is that his HP turns into AP
15:39
it's not really that effective at doing it but it should be good enough flight
15:44
is coming bought is there like multiple people bought it that's what I'm wondering like a weakled and Echo are here
15:56
okay I mean
16:05
oh I just need to press Q on him once and I would have demounted him but whatever I'm like full HP and he's super low so
16:12
even though I use my ultimate it's a one minute cooldown it's not too long and
16:18
he loses all of his pressure he now he's screwed right because he's just about to demount I don't think he'd realistically
16:24
ever fight me even with a teammate coming nearby he probably can't fight so he mounts him
16:32
and now he's in an even worse spot we can just continue pushing Vladimir is a pretty crazy 1v1ner so I'm not even
16:38
gonna stop his base he can base if he wants I don't care I'll just continue pressuring I feel like he was faking his base to try to get me to walk towards
16:44
him so he can get a nice Q off I I don't care if you're gonna base I'll just be able to hit the tower more that's okay
16:50
with me it's not even 20 minutes into the game yet so they don't even have uh home guards either
16:56
uh let's rotate mid just in case this Echo goes too aggressive here see you later never mind goodbye okay we
17:05
shouldn't take the inhibits bad so we should just back off now getting in here this early is pretty bad
17:11
only because Baron's not up and baron is a game-ending objective like getting an inner hip means that it's like three
17:17
minutes or four minutes of super minions I don't even know but during that entire time we don't even have an objective that's really that
17:23
important getting dragons isn't gonna end you a game it's just gonna give you a little bit of stats Baron literally
17:29
ends games because it gives you um it makes it so minions are harder to
17:35
kill so sieging is possible sieging isn't the easiest uh depending on the team comp even when inhib is down so
17:42
they could just free Farm the inhib because every single uh wave will give that super minion that gives like 90
17:48
gold and not only does it give 90 gold but uh it's gonna be killing our own
17:53
wave it's gonna kill their wave basically because we'll have the supers and then
17:58
that denies US Gold because nobody's gonna get it the supers Are Gonna Take It
18:04
foreign hopefully we get into one team fight
18:09
before the FF by the way I honestly feel like they've I think that they feel pretty doomed right now so
18:17
I'm hoping for a fight to break out because all I've been doing is just farming this entire time but that's honestly what Vlad does until like a big
18:23
Skirmish can break out maybe here
18:30
I can pop ghosts
18:39
okay this guy should die as well she doesn't really deal that much damage to me
18:45
by the way I'm at like one and a half items one cue oh he decided anyways oh hey I'm
18:52
I can just full tank this guy he won't even deal that much damage to me
18:58
okay well he one shot me never mind my Q was mid-cas which would heal me for a lot so honestly I thought I was just
19:04
gonna live I'm surprised at how much damage the backswing of his cuted so my bad on that
19:11
but I'm glad that I even got into a team fight before the game ends God damn it
19:19
oh by the way fappy's my friend so he's
19:25
just memeing he's not actually being toxic I know that some people might not know who he is but
19:31
um and be like why was that guy flaming you you didn't even do anything oh he is Lich Bane all right now I
19:37
understand why I died so
19:46
dude Tristan is going crazy my God but yeah I was not even too core yet and
19:53
you saw how easily I could kill sivir that's because we're at our power Spike right my e deals almost 600 damage and
20:02
it's on a three second cooldown so I have an AOE ability that's easy to
20:08
land when I'm on top of people that deals a ridiculous amount of damage and will only become stronger from this point forwards
20:15
and then I also have a q that deals 600 when it's empowered too
20:22
I was seeing if maybe they would try to contest also this Ward I thought maybe they were
20:28
tping but they're not just do it nice now I did use Flash and Go so that's
20:34
kind of a bummer because those are kind of important cooldowns to
20:39
run people down because at the end of the day you are short range that's also useful for the phase rush so you can also chase people but we'll have ghosts
20:46
very soon and then that will become so much easier to do stuff with
20:52
uh I am not there so it's honestly could turn into like the most terrible fight ever
21:02
yep everybody's deadish my bad I must have gotten people killed
21:10
we didn't even need to like uh start the baron I mean
21:16
don't think that's on me
21:25
I couldn't even pull the pride got 100-0 by Echo
21:31
he did 2 000 damage
21:45
well the good news is now the game will last longer so I can make it to like three core and stuff
21:51
but the thing is that it's going to be harder to oh wait this guy's so squishy
21:57
oh we're fine one good team fight is fine the thing is Vlad is also useful because
22:03
once again that 10 increased damage on the ultimate means that our whole entire team will be dealing a lot inside of Team fights
22:09
so I'm not really too worried plus also we're doing good Dragon wise as well but people have like the worst mental
22:15
breakdown so fast if a game ever starts going orally but
22:40
that didn't hit her I was trying to see if maybe she was like looking to hit me there but
22:49
she's ghosting away I don't think we can catch her
23:00
dude she's almost dead I just did so much damage there
23:09
Echo dies it's really good he has no olds but the thing is I'm really low
23:16
I popped ghost and pull back up very soon
23:24
dude my empowered ability didn't go off got that guy
23:31
I got that guy
23:37
oh please let me heal oh my god dude that was a good Showcase of why Vlad is
23:46
ridiculous in team fights right my cooldowns are basically non-existent besides pool like pool kind of matters a
23:52
lot but all I'm doing is just spamming my EQ over and over again and I'm healing a lot but also I'm doing huge
23:58
AOE damage and creating a ton of pressure because they can see this big damage ability coming out and they don't
24:03
want to get hit by that so people can also even get zoned by it so
24:09
they're trying to stall the game with that Bartle I guess we can't end just yet but now I
24:15
can buy deathcap very soon so we can go for like a double needless scenario uh we need 150 gold to be able to buy that
24:21
so maybe I just go do like Scuttle crab or something as long as nobody else takes it possibly
24:27
uh Teemo wants to look for them here but
24:33
I mean I can't really follow it up very well I'll give me Cannon okay we we got
24:39
enough for the thing so the double needless
24:45
our damage will once again Skyrocket I'll please let me bathe
24:53
thank you such a big buy look at our AP go from like 260 to 400. also we get tankier too
25:01
because AP turns in HP okay well we could have just sat under Tower but
25:08
you know it's fine I guess maybe it was undefendable that engaged I
25:13
don't I'm not really sure
25:22
uh I guess we'll just give this Dragon we just can't contest
25:28
I'll just do the uh wolves for now I don't really have anything to do
25:34
I'm not gonna try to be a hero it's normally not going to go very well maybe you've had ghost and Flash
25:41
I'd feel more confident maybe going through a hero play because I am playing a champion that can do that
25:48
my champagne is absolutely ridiculous at just going in 1v5 and getting everybody down to like half on his own within one
25:55
combo and then it only takes like two rotations to actually kill
26:02
well see you later Tristana we have to be careful here about the echo stun don't want to get hit by that
26:09
this guy is really fed with the Magis as well so his AP is like double mine
26:14
if he didn't have that Magi this would actually be pretty even items but he has a 25 stack
26:22
so I don't even think we can wave clear I guess I mean I was maybe planning on it but
26:28
oh why do I have to get hit by that dude
26:33
oh he's dead he instantly got him I still have my pool too
26:46
my Chase power is not very good without ghost as you can see she just ran away but that was good
26:52
they went forward and honestly I didn't need a pool because I realized that the echo stun expired so there is no chance
26:59
of getting chain CC by Echo stun and Bard oh that at least in folding our wave so all we have is this one Cannon
27:05
does that mean we can end with it oh we just take top and hip
27:12
I'm just gonna d-mount him just be annoying okay we have our death cap now jeez
27:17
we're getting really strong plus we have a gathering storm as well so two more minutes till another
27:22
gathering storm proc and then we get even stronger everyone's death cap boom huge buy and
27:30
then we can also start building we probably should get a stopwatch but we can't afford it so I'll just buy a
27:36
pink Ward instead buying an amped home doesn't really matter too much but yeah we have 3.5 K HP so very tanky
27:46
and also now we have a huge damage from our ultimate and everything really because we have for level 16 so
27:55
our empowered queue deals almost a thousand my empowered e deals almost a thousand
28:06
look at the damage apart huge
28:15
I'm looking for flank position because this is the best way to actually fight if if they go for my team I can go
28:22
behind them and really really mess them up
28:29
dude what we're I think we're gonna turn play more than anything else we're not gonna do the bearing because 50 50 is
28:34
way too difficult so we should definitely fight being pinged even though like the I'm in
28:40
a really good scenario that if my team started it I would be able to loot behind them and they wouldn't even see me because I'd be photographer
28:49
yeah everybody's dead here I kill everyone as soon as they walked near me it's just
28:56
like yeah you're all dead I deal way too much damage at this point so I can easily carry team fights
29:02
oh you ignited me I can't even catch up to him I'm too slow he's gonna maybe get
29:08
caught up by Soraka I didn't even see the trees all right nice Trace nice bait I guess just jumping in and getting Echo
29:14
to think that you're a free call so anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed the Vladimir commentary I mean show the
29:19
damage charts afterwards I'm pretty sure I probably didn't do the most but
29:25
581 on that guy and he has a wits end as well so
29:31
damage stack so anyways it was a decent Vladimir game I'm literally playing versus a
29:37
challenger player it's not easy for me to play as good as a challenger Vlad That's a problem with me playing
29:43
Champions that I'm not competent on because I don't play them a lot I need to play them very often to be
29:48
comfortable on them I'm gonna make a lot of mistakes and uh yeah so give it to fappy we'll play it
29:54
man trying to give me a click bait of flaming top laner playing Vlad I guess so thanks for watching guys did
30:03
second most damage actually did a little bit more damage than I was expecting did more than Echo so thanks for watching
30:09
hopefully you guys enjoyed the commentary of me playing Vladimir inside of hailo if you did enjoy be sure to give me a like on the video and feel
30:14
free to comment below about what you thought about it and I will see you guys in the next video thanks for watching again hope you have a good day and let
30:20
me double check yeah see you guys Challenger and also Echo main so that's who I was facing
30:26
anyways once again thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time bye
